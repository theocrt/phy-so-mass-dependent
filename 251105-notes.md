1. Obtained 1st fit for sigma_phi vs mass
   For large ages, expect sigma_phi ~ 1/sqrt(m)
   This is a sign of equilibrium, segregation of heavy objects have sinked in
   the core of the cluster
   Don't see this in the 1st example we used
   >> Next step 1: make a larger collection of trials (other models)
   >> Next step 2: use the data in _radial_bin.dat (radial distances) to observe segregation
2. Read the following papers
